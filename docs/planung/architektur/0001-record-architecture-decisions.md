# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-06-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to:
- Understand the reasoning behind past decisions
- Onboard new team members effectively
- Avoid repeating discussions about previously made decisions
- Track the evolution of our architecture

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

ADRs will be stored in `docs/adr/` and follow this naming convention:
- `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`
- NNNN is a 4-digit number incremented for each new ADR

Each ADR will contain:
- **Title**: Short present tense imperative phrase
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Status**: Draft | Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?
- **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this decision?

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear documentation of architectural decisions
- Historical context preserved for future developers
- Reduced time spent re-discussing past decisions
- Better onboarding for new team members

### Negative
- Requires discipline to maintain
- Additional documentation overhead
- May slow down decision-making initially

### Neutral
- We'll need to reference ADRs in pull requests when implementing decisions
- Team members should be encouraged to propose ADRs for significant changes
