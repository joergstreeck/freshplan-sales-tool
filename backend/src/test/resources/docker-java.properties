# Docker API Version Fix for Docker Desktop 4.53+ / Docker Engine 29.x
#
# Problem: Docker 29 raised minimum API version from 1.24 to 1.44
# Testcontainers 1.20.4 (shipped with Quarkus 3.17.4) defaults to 1.32
#
# This causes "BadRequestException (Status 400)" when starting containers
# See: https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/11212
#
# Solution: Explicitly set API version to 1.44 (minimum required by Docker 29)
# This property is read by docker-java library used by Testcontainers
#
# Note: Can be removed once Quarkus upgrades to Testcontainers 2.x
api.version=1.44
